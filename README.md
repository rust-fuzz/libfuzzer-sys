# ARCHIVED

This is the old, archived version of
[`rust-fuzz/libfuzzer`](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/libfuzzer) -- you almost
definitely want that instead of this.

We are keeping it around at this URL so that all the old existing `git =
"https://github.com/rust-fuzz/libfuzzer-sys.git"` dependencies that `cargo fuzz`
used to create continue to work, and we don't break anyone.
